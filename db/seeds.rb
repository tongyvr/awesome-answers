# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# 300.times do
#   Question.create title: Faker::Company.bs,
#                   body:  Faker::Hipster.paragraph,
#                   view_count: rand(100)
# end

# puts Cowsay.say "Generated 300 questions!"
